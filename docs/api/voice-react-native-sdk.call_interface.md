## Call interface

Defines strict typings for all events emitted by [Call objects](./voice-react-native-sdk.call_class.md)<!-- -->.

```typescript
export declare interface Call 
```

## Remarks

Note that the `on` function is an alias for the `addListener` function. They share identical functionality and either may be used interchangeably.

## Methods

|  Method | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [addListener(connectedEvent, listener)](./voice-react-native-sdk.call_interface.addlistener_methodsignature.md) | Connected event. Raised when the call has successfully connected. |
|  [addListener(connectFailureEvent, listener)](./voice-react-native-sdk.call_interface.addlistener_1_methodsignature.md) | Connect failure event. Raised when the call has failed to connect. |
|  [addListener(reconnectingEvent, listener)](./voice-react-native-sdk.call_interface.addlistener_2_methodsignature.md) | Reconnecting event. Raised when the call is reconnecting. |
|  [addListener(reconnectedEvent, listener)](./voice-react-native-sdk.call_interface.addlistener_3_methodsignature.md) | Reconnected event. Raised when the call has recovered and reconnected. |
|  [addListener(disconnectedEvent, listener)](./voice-react-native-sdk.call_interface.addlistener_4_methodsignature.md) | Disconnected event. Raised when the call has disconnected. |
|  [addListener(ringingEvent, listener)](./voice-react-native-sdk.call_interface.addlistener_5_methodsignature.md) | Ringing event. Raised when the call has begun to ring. |
|  [addListener(qualityWarningsChangedEvent, listener)](./voice-react-native-sdk.call_interface.addlistener_6_methodsignature.md) | Quality warnings changed event. Raised when a call quality warning is set or unset. All "ongoing" call quality warnings are passed to the invoked listener function. |
|  [addListener(messageReceivedEvent, listener)](./voice-react-native-sdk.call_interface.addlistener_7_methodsignature.md) | MessageReceived event. Raised when a [IncomingCallMessage](./voice-react-native-sdk.incomingcallmessage_class.md) is received. |
|  [addListener(callEvent, listener)](./voice-react-native-sdk.call_interface.addlistener_8_methodsignature.md) | Generic event listener typings. |
|  [on(connectedEvent, listener)](./voice-react-native-sdk.call_interface.on_methodsignature.md) | Connected event. Raised when the call has successfully connected. |
|  [on(connectFailureEvent, listener)](./voice-react-native-sdk.call_interface.on_1_methodsignature.md) | Connect failure event. Raised when the call has failed to connect. |
|  [on(reconnectingEvent, listener)](./voice-react-native-sdk.call_interface.on_2_methodsignature.md) | Reconnecting event. Raised when the call is reconnecting. |
|  [on(reconnectedEvent, listener)](./voice-react-native-sdk.call_interface.on_3_methodsignature.md) | Reconnected event. Raised when the call has recovered and reconnected. |
