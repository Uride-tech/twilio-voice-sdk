## Call.addListener() method

Disconnected event. Raised when the call has disconnected.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
addListener(disconnectedEvent: Call.Event.Disconnected, listener: Call.Listener.Disconnected): this;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  disconnectedEvent | [Call.Event.Disconnected](./voice-react-native-sdk.call_namespace.event_enum.md) | The raised event string. |
|  listener | [Call.Listener.Disconnected](./voice-react-native-sdk.call_namespace.listener_namespace.disconnected_typealias.md) | A listener function that will be invoked when the event is raised. |

<b>Returns:</b>

this

- The call object.

## Remarks

This event can occur in "naturally" disconnected calls and calls disconnected from issues such as network problems. If the SDK has detected an issue that has caused the call to disconnect, then the error parameter will be defined, otherwise it will be undefined.

## Example


```typescript
call.addListener(Call.Event.Disconnected, (error) => {
  // call has disconnected
  // if a natural disconnect occurred, then error is `undefined`
  // if an unnatural disconnect occurred, then error is defined
});
```
