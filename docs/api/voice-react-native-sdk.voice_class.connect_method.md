## Voice.connect() method

Create an outgoing call.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
connect(token: string, { contactHandle, notificationDisplayName, params, }?: Voice.ConnectOptions): Promise<Call>;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  token | string | A Twilio Access Token, usually minted by an authentication-gated endpoint using a Twilio helper library. |
|  { contactHandle, notificationDisplayName, params, } | [Voice.ConnectOptions](./voice-react-native-sdk.voice_namespace.connectoptions_typealias.md) | <i>(Optional)</i> |

<b>Returns:</b>

Promise&lt;[Call](./voice-react-native-sdk.call_class.md)<!-- -->&gt;

A `Promise` that - Resolves with a call when the call is created. - Rejects: \* When a call is not able to be created on the native layer. \* With an [TwilioErrors.InvalidArgumentError](./voice-react-native-sdk.twilioerrors_namespace.invalidargumenterror_class.md) when invalid arguments are passed.

## Remarks

Note that the resolution of the returned `Promise` does not imply any call event occurring, such as answered or rejected. The `contactHandle` parameter is only required for iOS apps. Currently the parameter does have any effect on Android apps and can be ignored. `Default Contact` will appear in the iOS call history if the value is empty or not provided.
